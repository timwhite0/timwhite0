### Hello!

I'm a first-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan. I recently finished up my undergradate degree in statistics at the University of Minnesota.

See [here](https://github.com/timwhite0/false-positives-calculator) and [here](https://github.com/timwhite0/MLBdash) for a couple of my past projects. You can also check out my website [here](timwhite0.github.io).
