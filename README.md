Hello!

I'm a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan. I'm interested in machine learning and Bayesian inference. My current work involves sequential Monte Carlo, simulation-based inference, and deep generative models. Before I came to Michigan, I got my undergraduate degree in statistics at the University of Minnesota.
