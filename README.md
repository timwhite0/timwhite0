Hello!

I'm a third-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan. I'm interested in machine learning and Bayesian inference. My current work involves sequential Monte Carlo and simulation-based inference. Before I came to Michigan, I got my undergraduate degree in statistics at the University of Minnesota.
