### Hello!

I'm a second-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan. I'm interested in Bayesian inference and computation, specifically sequential Monte Carlo, Markov chain Monte Carlo, and variational inference. Before I came to Michigan, I got my undergraduate degree in statistics at the University of Minnesota.
